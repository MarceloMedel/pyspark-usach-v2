partly	1
ascribed	1

the	1
name	1
chile	1
was	1
simple	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
quickly	1
adopted	1
that	1

were	1
soon	1
politically	1
grouped	1

of	1

and	1
when	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
definitely	1
colonised	1
the	1
name	1
was	1
extended	1
to	1
denote	1
all	1
the	1

	1
	1
the	1

already	1
a	1

it	1
had	1
yielded	1
so	1
much	1
treasure	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
probably	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1

to	1

it	1

the	1

that	1
he	1
contemplated	1

that	1

was	1
invited	1
to	1

noted	1
that	1
the	1

was	1
strongly	1

against	1

that	1

firing	1
five	1

in	1

he	1
asked	1
for	1
news	1
of	1

in	1
europe	1
said	1
they	1
had	1
much	1
trouble	1
with	1
the	1
valiant	1
and	1
barbarous	1
indians	1
who	1
fought	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
infested	1
the	1
camp	1
so	1
closely	1
that	1
the	1
spaniards	1
never	1
entered	1
the	1

nor	1
went	1
more	1
than	1
a	1

a	1
fine	1
dinner	1
was	1
served	1
upon	1

it	1
was	1
suggested	1
that	1
four	1

should	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
english	1
ship	1
with	1
the	1
lieutenant	1

pilot	1
her	1
into	1
the	1

narborough	1
remembered	1
the	1

tale	1
of	1
treacherous	1
dealings	1
with	1
captain	1
john	1
hawkins	1
at	1
st	1

although	1
he	1

talked	1
of	1
the	1
gold	1
they	1
found	1
here	1
and	1
troubles	1
with	1
the	1

the	1

with	1

of	1
the	1

declined	1
to	1
take	1
his	1

in	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
only	1
wanted	1
wood	1
and	1
fresh	1
water	1
on	1
december	1
17	1
he	1
sent	1
eighteen	1
men	1
ashore	1
to	1
barter	1
merchandise	1
with	1
the	1
spaniards	1
many	1
courtesies	1
being	1
exchanged	1
four	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
peru	1
of	1

who	1
had	1
never	1

on	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
the	1

to	1
say	1
that	1
they	1
had	1

asked	1
to	1

two	1

inside	1
the	1

where	1
the	1

his	1

politely	1
accepting	1
their	1

offering	1
them	1

but	1
when	1
they	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
cask	1
of	1
water	1
he	1
sent	1
soldiers	1
and	1
seized	1
the	1
boat	1
also	1
taking	1
the	1
englishmen	1
prisoners	1
saying	1
he	1

from	1

for	1
what	1

i	1
cannot	1

they	1
still	1
pretend	1

and	1
say	1
that	1

the	1

per	1

not	1

to	1
follow	1
the	1

recurred	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
happened	1
until	1
before	1

the	1

decided	1
to	1
attempt	1
a	1
northward	1

the	1

began	1
to	1
mend	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
they	1

the	1

a	1

twenty	1

embarked	1
on	1

crawled	1
along	1

broken	1
coast	1
frequently	1
being	1
forced	1
to	1
lie	1
upon	1
their	1
oars	1
all	1
night	1
since	1
the	1

breakers	1
prevented	1
a	1
landing	1
for	1
rest	1
and	1
shelter	1
the	1

sunk	1
when	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
round	1
the	1
headland	1
of	1
tres	1

peninsula	1

hereabouts	1
they	1
were	1
forced	1
since	1

carry	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
leave	1
on	1
shore	1
four	1
marines	1
giving	1
them	1
arms	1

what	1
other	1
provisions	1
they	1

these	1
plucky	1
men	1
stood	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1

out	1
of	1
sight	1
giving	1
three	1
cheers	1
and	1
calling	1
out	1
god	1
save	1
the	1
king	1
with	1
that	1
gesture	1
they	1
disappeared	1
from	1
history	1
for	1
when	1
the	1
barge	1
had	1
to	1
put	1
back	1
again	1
and	1
search	1
was	1
made	1
for	1
the	1

no	1
trace	1
was	1
found	1
but	1
a	1
musket	1
thrown	1
upon	1
the	1
beach	1
	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
seal	1
and	1
feasted	1
or	1
berries	1
and	1
lived	1
for	1
days	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
after	1
two	1
months	1
of	1
incessant	1
struggle	1
were	1
driven	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1

always	1
abused	1

that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1

the	1
dictum	1
that	1

would	1
go	1
to	1

the	1
representatives	1
of	1

found	1
that	1

that	1
his	1
goods	1
should	1
be	1
confiscated	1
that	1

said	1
that	1

and	1
that	1
he	1

not	1
convinced	1

he	1

wrote	1
to	1
the	1

an	1

suggested	1
that	1

before	1

as	1

priest	1
after	1
him	1
ordering	1
him	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
face	1

charges	1
aguirre	1
answered	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
in	1

going	1
up	1
to	1
the	1

looking	1

straight	1
in	1

asked	1
him	1

should	1
i	1
get	1
with	1
blanched	1

the	1

aguirre	1

not	1
over	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

sarmiento	1

was	1
presently	1
accused	1
not	1
of	1
complicity	1

of	1
knowledge	1
of	1
witchcraft	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
to	1
a	1

of	1

about	1
a	1
magic	1

which	1
made	1
the	1

beloved	1
by	1

he	1
had	1
two	1

had	1
seen	1
and	1
guaranteed	1
the	1
harmlessness	1
of	1
the	1
rings	1
but	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
sentence	1
of	1
naked	1
penance	1
in	1
lima	1

order	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
later	1
his	1
discovery	1
of	1

added	1
so	1
much	1
to	1

renown	1
that	1
upon	1

arrival	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
viceroy	1
francisco	1
de	1
toledo	1
in	1
1569	1

was	1
received	1
with	1

distinction	1
accompanying	1

accused	1
him	1
of	1
black	1
magic	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1

pronounced	1
him	1
a	1
dangerous	1
person	1

ordained	1
his	1

the	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
fighting	1
against	1
indian	1
tribes	1
of	1
the	1
andean	1
forests	1
and	1
the	1
viceroy	1
told	1
the	1
inquisitors	1
that	1
he	1
required	1
his	1
services	1
but	1
they	1
came	1
forward	1
presently	1
with	1
an	1
accusation	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
foretold	1
deaths	1
by	1
the	1
lines	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
was	1
declared	1
guilty	1
imprisoned	1
in	1
1575	1
and	1
only	1
released	1
upon	1
the	1
insistence	1
of	1
the	1
viceroy	1
sarmiento	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
chiefly	1
suspect	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
scientific	1
man	1
of	1
penetrating	1
mind	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
own	1
writings	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
devout	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1

followed	1

he	1
was	1
imprisoned	1
and	1

when	1

nearly	1
three	1

in	1

1586	1
an	1

this	1
did	1
not	1
occur	1

had	1

passed	1

hernandez	1
then	1
sixty	1
two	1

displays	1
no	1
feeling	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1

and	1
it	1
is	1
remarkable	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
interrogatories	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
denote	1
the	1
least	1
concern	1
regarding	1

	1
hernandez	1
gave	1
an	1
ingenuous	1
and	1
straightforward	1
account	1
from	1
the	1

so	1

were	1
concerned	1
he	1
never	1

simply	1
said	1
two	1
months	1
after	1

had	1
gone	1
the	1

from	1
nombre	1
de	1

came	1
to	1
join	1
the	1

it	1
was	1
then	1
august	1

they	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
storm	1
that	1
blew	1
sarmiento	1
s	1
ship	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
andres	1
de	1
viedma	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
charge	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
hunger	1
of	1
the	1
settlers	1
by	1
organising	1
200	1
soldiers	1
into	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
shell	1
fish	1
hunters	1
	1
during	1
all	1
the	1
winter	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
summer	1
they	1
waited	1
hoping	1
for	1
help	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
food	1
but	1
the	1
wild	1
berries	1
and	1
such	1
sea	1
food	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
secure	1
then	1
they	1
built	1
two	1
boats	1
and	1
the	1
survivors	1
fifty	1
men	1
and	1
five	1
women	1
started	1
out	1
towards	1
the	1
eastern	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
strait	1
but	1
no	1
sailors	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
navigate	1
well	1
and	1
one	1
boat	1
ran	1
ashore	1
and	1
was	1
lost	1
the	1
surviving	1
boat	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
so	1
some	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
philip	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
scattered	1
along	1
the	1
shore	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
shell	1
fish	1
to	1
preserve	1
their	1
lives	1
during	1
the	1
winter	1
	1
when	1
summer	1
came	1
viedma	1
assembled	1
the	1
survivors	1
fifteen	1
men	1
and	1
astonishing	1
witness	1
to	1

endurance	1
three	1
women	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
had	1
died	1
of	1
hunger	1

sickness	1
they	1
agreed	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
settlement	1
as	1
nearer	1
possible	1
rescue	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
way	1
by	1
land	1
finding	1
many	1
dead	1
bodies	1
of	1
their	1
comrades	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
twelve	1
miles	1
beyond	1
cape	1
geronimo	1
they	1
saw	1
four	1
ships	1
which	1
they	1
thought	1
were	1
spanish	1
but	1
which	1
were	1
actually	1
the	1
boats	1
of	1
cavendish	1
a	1
boat	1
came	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
beach	1
and	1
the	1
settlers	1
were	1
told	1
the	1
nationality	1
of	1
the	1
ships	1
and	1
offered	1
a	1
passage	1
to	1
peru	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
shore	1
replied	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
thrown	1
overboard	1
getting	1
the	1
response	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
well	1
embark	1
as	1
those	1
on	1
the	1
ships	1
were	1
better	1
christians	1
than	1
we	1
were	1
after	1
some	1
parleying	1
hernandez	1
was	1
taken	1
aboard	1
to	1
cavendish	1
himself	1
who	1
upon	1
hearing	1
that	1
these	1
folk	1
were	1
survivors	1
of	1
the	1
settlement	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
vessels	1
but	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
rare	1
good	1
weather	1
in	1
the	1
strait	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
penguin	1
island	1
for	1
birds	1
which	1
he	1
salted	1
down	1
in	1
casks	1
he	1
sailed	1
thence	1
to	1
the	1
abandoned	1
city	1
of	1
philip	1
stayed	1
there	1
four	1
days	1
taking	1
on	1
wood	1

water	1
and	1
brought	1
away	1
the	1
six	1
pieces	1

was	1
made	1
at	1
the	1
port	1
of	1
quintero	1
the	1

ashore	1
to	1
pretend	1
to	1
the	1
spanish	1
that	1
the	1

were	1
from	1

but	1
hernandez	1
gave	1

warning	1
to	1

were	1
needed	1
besides	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
their	1
desperate	1
plight	1
it	1
exists	1
in	1
the	1
ungrateful	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
man	1
he	1
took	1
away	1
whose	1

took	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
sending	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
helpers	1
to	1
the	1
scaffold	1
	1
of	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
these	1
last	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
band	1
of	1
settlers	1
who	1
had	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
spain	1
with	1
such	1
high	1
hopes	1
we	1

only	1
that	1
in	1
1590	1
one	1
man	1
signalled	1
to	1
the	1
_delight_	1
of	1

was	1
taken	1
on	1

died	1
on	1
the	1

to	1
europe	1
without	1
leaving	1
his	1

were	1
taken	1
into	1

were	1
not	1

hostile	1
hernandez	1
answering	1
his	1

in	1

that	1
for	1
three	1
months	1
a	1
spanish	1

captured	1
on	1

by	1
the	1

arrangement	1
was	1
made	1
only	1
between	1
chile	1
and	1
peru	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
truce	1
with	1

in	1
1884	1
and	1
a	1
definite	1

in	1

	1
chile	1
has	1
been	1
blamed	1
for	1
making	1
hard	1
terms	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
sister	1
states	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
undeniable	1
that	1
despite	1
the	1
struggle	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
allies	1
to	1
which	1
chilean	1
historians	1
have	1
frequently	1
given	1
credit	1
they	1
were	1
utterly	1
out	1
fought	1
chile	1
was	1
completely	1
victorious	1
on	1
sea	1
and	1
land	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
victory	1
she	1
had	1
she	1
considered	1
been	1
menaced	1
and	1
she	1
disposed	1
of	1
future	1
menace	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
severe	1
she	1
had	1
many	1
great	1
examples	1
to	1
follow	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
little	1
curious	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
united	1
states	1
with	1
the	1
record	1
of	1
acquisitions	1
of	1
mexican	1
territory	1
constantly	1
raising	1
a	1
minatory	1
finger	1
to	1
chile	1
this	1
finger	1
appeared	1
during	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
of	1
the	1
pacific	1
and	1
upon	1
several	1
subsequent	1
occasions	1
including	1
a	1
curious	1
incident	1
in	1
1920	1
when	1
a	1
flutter	1
of	1
local	1
feeling	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
coast	1
was	1
made	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
a	1
tactless	1
message	1
from	1
the	1
state	1
department	1
these	1
admonitions	1
are	1
resented	1
by	1
and	1
are	1
embarrassing	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
more	1
than	1
american	1
_comerciantes_	1
and	1
miners	1
operating	1
in	1
chile	1
it	1
is	1
unfortunate	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
united	1
states	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
west	1
coast	1
that	1
a	1
non	1
comprehension	1
of	1
chilean	1
intentions	1
and	1
sentiment	1
should	1
not	1
only	1
add	1
fuel	1
to	1
the	1
flame	1
but	1
should	1
keep	1
alive	1
ideas	1
of	1
forcible	1
intervention	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
losers	1
in	1
the	1

in	1

under	1

	1
in	1

asked	1

to	1
examine	1
the	1

to	1
obtaining	1
international	1
influence	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
modification	1
of	1

peru	1
afterwards	1
withdrew	1
her	1
request	1
while	1
the	1
commission	1
appointed	1
to	1
consider	1
bolivia	1
s	1
case	1
came	1
unanimously	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
no	1
intervention	1
was	1
possible	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
definitely	1
signed	1
treaty	1
handing	1
down	1
this	1
decision	1
in	1
november	1
1921	1
but	1
the	1
chilean	1
delegate	1
don	1
agustin	1
edwards	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
that	1
chile	1
was	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
discuss	1
amicably	1
with	1
bolivia	1
any	1
suggestion	1
for	1
the	1
economic	1
improvement	1
of	1
bolivia	1
s	1
position	1
compatible	1
with	1
chilean	1
interests	1
and	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
paved	1
for	1
friendly	1
discussions	1
	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
chile	1
made	1
a	1
direct	1
offer	1
to	1
the	1
peruvian	1
administration	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
diplomatic	1
representatives	1
that	1
the	1
plebiscite	1
should	1
be	1
held	1
in	1
accord	1
with	1
the	1
terms	1
agreed	1
upon	1
during	1
discussions	1
in	1
1912	1
when	1
1923	1
was	1
fixed	1
as	1
the	1
voting	1
year	1
peru	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
this	1
suggestion	1
acceptable	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
chileanisation	1
of	1
tacna	1
proceeds	1
with	1
such	1
rapidity	1
that	1
the	1
peruvian	1
vote	1
would	1
be	1
practically	1
non	1
existent	1
all	1
children	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
since	1
1883	1
are	1
counted	1
as	1
chilean	1
citizens	1
and	1
the	1
exodus	1
of	1
adult	1
peruvians	1
from	1
this	1
and	1
other	1
regions	1
has	1
been	1
marked	1
since	1
1920	1
when	1
a	1
sudden	1
access	1
of	1
local	1
friction	1
brought	1
about	1
the	1
mutual	1
withdrawal	1
of	1
consular	1
officials	1
	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
when	1
it	1
seemed	1
unfortunately	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
attempt	1
at	1
settlement	1
would	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
previous	1
efforts	1
the	1
united	1
states	1
interposed	1
with	1
the	1
suggestion	1
that	1
representatives	1
of	1
peru	1
and	1
chile	1
should	1
meet	1
for	1
friendly	1
discussions	1
in	1
washington	1
this	1
offer	1
was	1
accepted	1
by	1
both	1
lima	1
and	1
santiago	1
and	1
delegates	1
were	1
appointed	1
in	1
early	1
1922	1
	1
peru	1
wished	1
to	1
re	1
open	1
the	1
whole	1
treaty	1
of	1
ancon	1
but	1
chile	1
emphatically	1
declared	1
that	1
only	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
tacna	1
plebiscite	1
were	1
matters	1
for	1
discussion	1
she	1
also	1
declined	1
bolivia	1

request	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
meetings	1

without	1

the	1

announcing	1

that	1
no	1

concerning	1
the	1

	1
the	1

of	1

to	1

in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
mr	1

took	1

between	1

ending	1
in	1
a	1
hopeful	1
agreement	1
signed	1
by	1
the	1

in	1
july	1
this	1
agreement	1
terminated	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
peace	1
and	1
practically	1
amounted	1
to	1
the	1
acceptance	1
of	1
arbitration	1
	1
the	1
immediate	1
question	1
laid	1
before	1
the	1
american	1
arbitrators	1
is	1
whether	1
or	1
no	1
the	1
plebiscite	1
should	1
be	1
held	1
and	1
if	1
so	1
upon	1
what	1
terms	1
the	1
voting	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
further	1
agreed	1
chile	1
cheerfully	1
accepting	1
a	1
peruvian	1
suggestion	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
decision	1
should	1
be	1
reached	1
precluding	1
a	1
plebiscite	1
nevertheless	1
negotiations	1
should	1
be	1
continued	1

the	1
outlook	1

that	1
which	1

floor	1
remains	1
of	1
shell	1
fish	1

occasionally	1

imbedded	1
in	1

and	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
iodine	1
is	1
also	1
adduced	1
as	1
contributory	1
evidence	1
but	1
bromine	1
is	1
curiously	1
absent	1
and	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
complicated	1
by	1
other	1
geological	1
displays	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
certainly	1
seem	1

the	1
seriously	1

theory	1
that	1
the	1

drained	1
down	1
under	1
the	1

from	1

and	1
that	1
the	1

upon	1

my	1

sometimes	1
ascribed	1
to	1

sometimes	1
to	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1

by	1
the	1

sometimes	1
to	1
the	1
action	1
of	1

which	1
have	1
diverted	1
rivers	1
from	1
their	1
original	1
courses	1
and	1
is	1
certainly	1
to	1
be	1
attributed	1
in	1
many	1
cases	1
to	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
the	1

rushing	1
from	1

are	1
of	1
great	1
value	1

are	1
never	1
more	1
strikingly	1
proved	1
than	1
in	1
such	1
times	1
of	1
stress	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
1921	1
when	1
small	1
and	1
inexperienced	1
firms	1
broke	1
under	1
the	1
storm	1
that	1
the	1

were	1
able	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
long	1
usage	1
and	1
wide	1
credit	1
	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
complained	1
against	1
this	1
array	1
of	1
impregnable	1
commercial	1
castles	1
that	1
their	1

tends	1
to	1
render	1

territory	1
offering	1
but	1
a	1
cold	1
welcome	1
to	1
the	1
newcomer	1
in	1
trade	1
i	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
heavy	1
tax	1
upon	1
commercial	1
travellers	1
in	1
chile	1
charged	1
against	1
the	1
suggestion	1
of	1
the	1
big	1
houses	1
but	1
even	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
foundation	1
for	1
these	1
complaints	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
for	1
instance	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
established	1
firms	1
having	1
sown	1
for	1
several	1
generations	1
are	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
enthusiastic	1
when	1
a	1
brand	1
new	1
reaping	1
hook	1
makes	1
an	1
appearance	1
thinking	1
of	1
their	1
long	1
cultivation	1
of	1
the	1
soil	1
big	1
investment	1
and	1
big	1
overhead	1
charges	1
they	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
regard	1
the	1
débutant	1
travelling	1
salesman	1
as	1
a	1
raider	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
looking	1
askance	1
at	1
comprehensive	1
plans	1
launched	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
years	1
for	1
direct	1
selling	1
to	1
consumers	1
by	1
groups	1
of	1
home	1
manufacturers	1
	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
chile	1
is	1
not	1
singular	1
in	1
levying	1
a	1
heavy	1
tax	1
upon	1
the	1
commercial	1
traveller	1
and	1
its	1
assessment	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
partly	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
pressing	1
need	1
of	1
latin	1
america	1
during	1
recent	1
years	1
to	1
discover	1
new	1
sources	1
of	1
revenue	1
few	1
american	1
countries	1
have	1
even	1
attempted	1
to	1
face	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
direct	1
tax	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
chief	1
source	1
of	1
revenue	1
derived	1
from	1
import	1
and	1

dues	1
are	1
affected	1
immediately	1
by	1
every	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
commercial	1
barometer	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
stress	1
all	1
possible	1
founts	1
are	1
examined	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
search	1
the	1
foreign	1
commercial	1
traveller	1
himself	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
amongst	1
the	1
imports	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
rather	1
a	1
necessity	1
than	1
an	1
article	1
of	1
luxury	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
recognition	1
of	1
this	1
fact	1
that	1
may	1
help	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
frequent	1
evasion	1
of	1
payments	1
of	1
the	1
tax	1
	1
chilean	1
law	1
requires	1
travellers	1
representing	1
foreign	1
firms	1
to	1
buy	1
in	1
each	1
province	1
visited	1
a	1
_patente_	1
licence	1
costing	1
1000	1
pesos	1
with	1
the	1
paper	1
peso	1
at	1
an	1
exchange	1
value	1
of	1
one	1
shilling	1
this	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
50	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
traverse	1
chilean	1
commercial	1
towns	1
from	1
valdivia	1
to	1
coquimbo	1
the	1
traveller	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
spend	1
400	1
or	1
500	1
on	1
licences	1
the	1
consequence	1
is	1
that	1
visits	1
are	1
either	1
confined	1
to	1
a	1
strictly	1
limited	1
number	1
of	1
cities	1
perhaps	1
to	1
santiago	1
and	1
valparaiso	1
only	1
or	1
an	1
arrangement	1
is	1
made	1
by	1
which	1

carries	1
the	1
business	1
card	1
of	1
a	1

not	1

in	1
many	1

	1
the	1

of	1
trade	1
marks	1
in	1

is	1
attended	1
by	1
the	1

difficulties	1
which	1

goods	1

countries	1
encounter	1
in	1
many	1

rights	1
in	1
a	1
trade	1
mark	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
registering	1
the	1
mark	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
unusual	1
for	1
a	1
foreign	1
maker	1
or	1
agent	1
entering	1
the	1
country	1
with	1
some	1
special	1

for	1

to	1
find	1
that	1
his	1
emblem	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
registered	1
by	1
some	1
enterprising	1

unscrupulous	1
person	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
bought	1
out	1
if	1
any	1

is	1
to	1
be	1

the	1

litigation	1
has	1
raged	1
about	1

the	1

consists	1
in	1
speedy	1

reasons	1
for	1

the	1

a	1

the	1

reason	1
which	1

undoubtedly	1
this	1

produces	1
the	1

it	1

	1
_the	1

	1
the	1

of	1

at	1
the	1

of	1

of	1
stone	1
slabs	1
called	1
_ahus_	1
upon	1

under	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
buried	1

upon	1

was	1
crowned	1
with	1
an	1
enormous	1

only	1
one	1
of	1

identified	1
three	1
roads	1
apparently	1
connected	1
with	1
tribal	1
ceremonies	1

in	1
size	1
some	1
weighing	1
40	1
to	1
50	1

all	1
follow	1
a	1
similar	1
design	1
a	1
tremendous	1
face	1
with	1
closed	1
lips	1
and	1
long	1
nose	1
with	1
a	1
concave	1

the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
is	1
so	1
narrow	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
negligible	1

a	1
distinguishing	1
feature	1
is	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1

to	1
four	1

five	1
times	1
the	1

carved	1
with	1
some	1
care	1
and	1
a	1
curious	1
design	1
that	1
includes	1
circles	1
is	1
often	1
marked	1
out	1
upon	1
it	1
the	1
shoulders	1
are	1
well	1
shaped	1
but	1
the	1
arms	1
and	1

are	1
shown	1
by	1
a	1
simple	1
and	1
well	1
conventionalised	1
method	1

generally	1
shaped	1
into	1
a	1

for	1
convenient	1
erection	1
severely	1
simple	1
and	1
quite	1
primitive	1
as	1
the	1

there	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
dignity	1
a	1
repose	1
about	1
the	1
slightly	1
up	1
tilted	1

that	1
is	1
impressive	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
statues	1
_en	1

as	1
they	1
are	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
many	1
of	1

the	1
faces	1
looking	1
out	1
from	1
the	1

on	1
the	1

remarkable	1
even	1
through	1
the	1
deadening	1
medium	1
of	1
a	1
black	1

white	1

why	1

the	1

as	1

special	1
inner	1

so	1
apparently	1
were	1
the	1

it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
an	1
itch	1
for	1
carving	1
for	1
in	1
certain	1
regions	1
every	1
piece	1
of	1
stone	1
that	1
projected	1
from	1
the	1

has	1
been	1
carved	1
as	1
it	1

without	1
any	1

to	1

it	1
perhaps	1
a	1
beneficent	1
influence	1
was	1
created	1
with	1
each	1
serene	1
carved	1
face	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
statues	1
were	1
set	1
up	1
to	1
mark	1
boundaries	1
and	1
were	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
that	1

in	1

a	1
fact	1
which	1
called	1
for	1
investigation	1
by	1
the	1

stress	1
was	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
listing	1

declared	1

a	1

to	1

	1

there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
no	1

that	1
the	1

high	1
for	1

a	1
fact	1
surprising	1
in	1

of	1

it	1
should	1

perhaps	1
without	1
sufficient	1
reason	1
of	1
setting	1
their	1
faces	1
against	1
the	1
civil	1

and	1
there	1
was	1
certainly	1
a	1
period	1
in	1
chile	1
when	1
the	1

enforced	1
when	1
